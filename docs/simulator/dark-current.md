# Dark Current & Temperature

Simulate thermally generated dark current in CMOS pixels and visualize its impact on image quality across operating temperatures.

## Physics

Dark current is the signal generated by thermal carrier generation in the absence of light. It follows the Arrhenius model:

**J_d(T) proportional to exp(-E_g / 2kT)**

where E_g is the silicon bandgap (~1.12 eV), k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is absolute temperature.

### Temperature Doubling Rule

A widely used approximation: dark current approximately doubles for every 6-8 degrees C increase in temperature. This makes thermal management critical for long-exposure and scientific imaging applications.

### Impact on Image Quality

- **Noise floor** — dark current shot noise (sqrt of dark signal) adds to the total noise, degrading SNR in low-light conditions
- **Fixed pattern noise** — pixel-to-pixel variation in dark current creates a static pattern that must be subtracted via dark frame calibration
- **Hot pixels** — defect sites with anomalously high dark current appear as bright dots, becoming more prevalent at elevated temperatures

### Dark Frame Simulation

The simulator generates a synthetic dark frame showing statistical variation across pixels, including the long tail of hot pixels characteristic of real sensors.

::: tip
For scientific cameras, cooling the sensor by 20 degrees C can reduce dark current by roughly 8x, dramatically improving performance for long exposures.
