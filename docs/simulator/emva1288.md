# EMVA 1288 Dashboard

Integrated sensor characterization dashboard based on the EMVA 1288 standard (Release 4.0). Simulates all key performance parameters from pixel design inputs.

## EMVA 1288 Standard

The European Machine Vision Association standard EMVA 1288 defines a unified methodology for measuring and reporting image sensor performance. Key parameters include:

### Sensitivity Metrics
- **Quantum Efficiency (QE)** — photon-to-electron conversion efficiency
- **Responsivity** — output signal per unit irradiance (A/W)
- **Absolute Sensitivity Threshold** — minimum detectable photon count

### Noise Metrics
- **Temporal Dark Noise** — read noise in electrons RMS
- **PRNU** — pixel-to-pixel gain variation
- **SNR_max** — maximum achievable SNR = sqrt(FWC)

### Capacity Metrics
- **Saturation Capacity (FWC)** — maximum charge per pixel
- **Dynamic Range** — ratio of FWC to noise floor
- **Useful Bits** — effective ADC resolution considering noise

### Grade System

Parameters are color-coded by quality:
- **Green** — excellent performance for the metric
- **Blue** — typical/acceptable performance
- **Red** — below typical, may limit application suitability

::: tip
The SNR curve shows actual vs ideal (shot-noise-limited) performance. The gap between curves indicates how much the sensor deviates from ideal photon counting.
