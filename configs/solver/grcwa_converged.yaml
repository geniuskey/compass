# @package _global_
# High-accuracy grcwa preset with converged parameters.
# Use for final results and validation. Slower but numerically accurate.
#
# Convergence study results (550nm, BSI 1um pixel):
#   nG=49:  A=0.9699, 0.95s   (converged within 0.2% of final)
#   nG=121: A=0.9712, 5.4s    (stable, recommended for high accuracy)
#   n_lens_slices converges at 15, fully stable by 30
#   grid_multiplier=3 is optimal (even values cause grcwa instability)
