# @package _global_
# High-accuracy grcwa preset with converged parameters.
# Use for final results and validation.
#
# Convergence study results (BSI 1um pixel, full visible spectrum):
#   nG=49:  A=0.9699 at 550nm, stable across 400-700nm (R+T+A=1.000)
#   nG=121: Stable at 550nm but "Singular matrix" at 400nm, 500nm — avoid
#   n_lens_slices converges at 15, fully stable by 30
#   grid_multiplier=3 is optimal (even values cause grcwa instability)
#
# For higher accuracy, use torcwa with [7,7] or higher.
